								<h1>Different Mental Health Questionnaires</h1>
                                <h2>Depression</h2>
								<p>Depression is a mental health condition that affects how a person feels, thinks, and handles daily activities. Common symptoms include persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, changes in appetite or sleep, fatigue, and feelings of worthlessness. It can make even simple tasks feel overwhelming, and people may struggle to concentrate or make decisions. Depression varies in severity and duration, sometimes leading to thoughts of self-harm.</p>
								<p>It’s essential to understand that depression isn’t a sign of weakness or something one can "snap out of" Treatment options include therapy, medication, lifestyle changes, and support from loved ones. Early intervention can significantly improve outcomes.</p>

								<h2>Anxiety</h2>
                                <p>Anxiety is a feeling of unease, worry, or fear that can range from mild to severe. It’s a normal response to stress or uncertainty, but when it becomes overwhelming or constant, it may interfere with daily life. Common symptoms include a racing heart, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and sweating. These reactions are part of the body’s “fight or flight” response, designed to help us face danger, but they can become problematic if triggered by everyday situations.</p>
								<p>Managing anxiety often involves a combination of strategies. Deep breathing, regular exercise, and mindfulness can help reduce symptoms. For ongoing or severe anxiety, therapy or medication might be necessary to regain control.</p>
